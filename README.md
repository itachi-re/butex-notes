## 🛠️ Workflow & Usage

### 📝 Creating a New Note

Use the automated script to create properly formatted notes:

```bash
# Syntax: ./scripts/new_note.sh [COURSE_CODE] [FILE_NAME]
./scripts/new_note.sh YE-201 02_fiber_length_testing

# This creates: YE-201/02_fiber_length_testing.md
# With pre-filled template including date, course info, and structure
```

**Manual Method:**
```bash
cp _templates/note_template.md COURSE-CODE/topic_name.md
# Edit the frontmatter and add your content
```

### 📤 Exporting to PDF

Convert all notes to PDF format with proper formatting:

```bash
# Export all markdown notes to PDF
./scripts/build_all.sh

# Output will be in: exported_pdfs/
# Maintains directory structure: exported_pdfs/YE-101/01_natural_fibres.pdf
```

**Requirements:**
- Pandoc: `sudo zypper in pandoc`
- LaTeX: `sudo zypper in texlive-scheme-basic`
