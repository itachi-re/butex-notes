## 1. Introduction to Analytical Chemistry

### 1.1 Definition

Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It involves identifying what is present in a sample (qualitative analysis) and how much is present (quantitative analysis).

### 1.2 Classification of Analytical Methods

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Identifies the presence or absence of species
- Answers "What is it?"

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Determines the amount or concentration of species
- Answers "How much is present?"

**Gravimetric analysis** is a classical quantitative method based on measuring mass.

## 2. Overview of Gravimetric Analysis

### 2.1 Definition

Gravimetric analysis is a quantitative analytical technique where the analyte (substance being analyzed) is isolated and weighed either directly or after conversion into a substance of known composition.

**Principle:** The mass of the analyte or its derivative is directly measured, allowing calculation of the amount or concentration of the original analyte.

### 2.2 Types of Gravimetric Methods

1. **Precipitation Gravimetry:** Analyte converted to precipitate and weighed
2. **Volatilization Gravimetry:** Analyte or its decomposition product volatilized and measured
3. **Electrogravimetry:** Analyte deposited on electrode through electrolysis
4. **Particulate Gravimetry:** Suspended solids filtered and weighed

### 2.3 Advantages

1. **High accuracy and precision:** ±0.1% or better when performed correctly
2. **No calibration required:** Direct measurement of mass
3. **Absolute method:** Does not require standards
4. **Simple equipment:** No expensive instrumentation needed
5. **Reliable:** Well-established methods with proven reliability
6. **Can calibrate other methods:** Used as reference standard

### 2.4 Disadvantages

1. **Time-consuming:** Multiple steps, long analysis time
2. **Limited selectivity:** Analyzes single element or limited group
3. **Requires relatively large sample amounts:** Typically 0.1-1 g
4. **Susceptible to contamination:** Multiple handling steps
5. **Skill-dependent:** Requires careful technique
6. **Not suitable for trace analysis:** Detection limits in ppm range at best

### 2.5 Requirements for Success

1. **Complete separation:** Analyte must be completely isolated
2. **High purity:** Precipitate or product must be pure
3. **Known composition:** Chemical formula must be definite and known
4. **Low solubility:** Losses due to solubility must be negligible (<0.1%)
5. **Easy filtration:** Precipitate must be easily filtered and washed

---

## 3. Precipitation Gravimetry

### 3.1 Principle

The analyte reacts with a precipitating agent to form a sparingly soluble precipitate, which is filtered, dried or ignited, and weighed.

**General Process:**
Analyte(solution) + Precipitating Agent → Precipitate(solid) → Pure Compound(weighed)

### 3.2 Ideal Precipitate Properties

1. **Low solubility:** Solubility product (Ksp) should be very small
2. **High purity:** Free from contaminants
3. **Known composition:** Definite chemical formula after drying/ignition
4. **Large particle size:** Easy to filter, less surface area for adsorption
5. **Chemical stability:** Does not decompose or react with air
6. **Easily filterable:** Does not clog filter paper
7. **Complete precipitation:** >99.9% of analyte precipitated

### 3.3 Types of Precipitates

**Crystalline Precipitates:**
- Large, well-formed crystals
- Examples: BaSO₄, AgCl
- Advantages: Easy to filter, high purity
- Form under conditions of low supersaturation

**Curdy Precipitates:**
- Small particles that aggregate
- Example: AgCl
- Intermediate properties

**Gelatinous Precipitates:**
- Amorphous, jelly-like
- Examples: Al(OH)₃, Fe(OH)₃
- Disadvantages: Difficult to filter, tend to trap impurities
- Form under conditions of high supersaturation

**Colloidal Precipitates:**
- Very small particles (10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁴ cm)
- Pass through filter paper unless coagulated
- Examples: AgCl, BaSO₄ (under certain conditions)

### 3.4 Precipitation Mechanism

**Two Stages:**

**Nucleation:**
- Initial formation of small, stable crystal nuclei
- Rapid process
- Occurs when solution is supersaturated

**Particle Growth:**
- Addition of ions to existing nuclei
- Slower process
- Produces larger particles

### 3.5 Relative Supersaturation (RSS)

RSS = (Q - S) / S

Where:
- Q = actual concentration of solute
- S = equilibrium solubility

**Effect on Precipitate:**
- **High RSS:** Many small crystals (colloidal)
- **Low RSS:** Few large crystals (crystalline)

**Goal:** Minimize RSS to favor particle growth over nucleation

### 3.6 Controlling Particle Size

**To obtain large crystals (desirable):**

1. **Use dilute solutions:** Reduces Q
2. **Add precipitant slowly with stirring:** Prevents local high concentrations
3. **Increase temperature:** Increases S (solubility)
4. **Use homogeneous precipitation:** Precipitant generated slowly in solution
5. **Allow digestion:** Heat precipitate in contact with mother liquid

### 3.7 Digestion

**Purpose:** Improve precipitate quality

**Process:**
- Heat precipitate in mother liquid for 30 min to several hours
- Small particles dissolve and redeposit on larger particles (Ostwald ripening)
- Reduces coprecipitation and adsorption
- Improves filterability

### 3.8 Coprecipitation

**Definition:** Contamination where normally soluble compounds are carried down with the precipitate.

**Types:**

**Surface Adsorption:**
- Ions adsorb on precipitate surface
- More significant with small particles (large surface area)
- Minimized by: digestion, washing, reprecipitation

**Occlusion:**
- Impurities trapped within crystal during rapid growth
- Minimized by: slow precipitation, digestion

**Inclusion:**
- Ion replacement in crystal lattice (similar size/charge)
- Cannot be removed by washing
- Minimized by: slow precipitation, pure reagents

**Mechanical Entrapment:**
- Solution trapped in cavities during aggregation
- Removed by: washing, digestion

### 3.9 Post-Precipitation

**Definition:** Initially soluble substance precipitates on existing precipitate surface after standing.

**Causes:**
- Surface acts as nucleation site
- Usually more soluble compound precipitates slowly

**Prevention:**
- Filter immediately after digestion
- Use appropriate digestion time

### 3.10 Common Precipitating Agents

**For Cations:**
| Precipitating Agent | Ions Precipitated | Precipitate |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| H₂S | Many metal ions | Metal sulfides |

- Specific for Ni and Pd

### 3.12 Example: Determination of Sulfate as BaSO₄

**Reaction:**
Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)

**Procedure:**
1. Dissolve sample in dilute HCl (pH 1-2)
2. Heat solution to 80-90°C
3. Add BaCl₂ solution slowly with stirring (3-5 min)
4. Digest on hot plate (30-60 min)
5. Test for complete precipitation (add drop of BaCl₂ to supernatant)
6. Cool and filter through ashless filter paper
7. Wash with warm water
8. Dry filter paper with precipitate
9. Transfer to crucible and ignite at 800°C
10. Cool in desiccator and weigh
11. Calculate SO₄²⁻ content

**Special Considerations:**

## 8. Calculations and Data Analysis

### 8.1 Basic Gravimetric Calculation

**General Formula:**
% Analyte = (mass of analyte / mass of sample) × 100

**Using Gravimetric Factor:**
Gravimetric Factor (GF) = (Formula weight of analyte × # atoms analyte) / (Formula weight of precipitate × # formula units precipitate)

**Example 1: Determination of Chloride as AgCl**

Given:
- Sample mass = 0.5000 g
- AgCl precipitate mass = 0.4368 g
- Find: % Cl in sample

Solution:
- Molecular weights: Cl = 35.45, AgCl = 143.32
- GF = 35.45/143.32 = 0.2474
- Mass Cl = 0.4368 × 0.2474 = 0.1081 g
- % Cl = (0.1081/0.5000) × 100 = 21.62%

**Example 2: Determination of Sulfate as BaSO₄**

Given:
- Sample mass = 0.7500 g
- BaSO₄ precipitate mass = 0.5832 g
- Find: % SO₄²⁻ in sample

Solution:
- Molecular weights: SO₄ = 96.06, BaSO₄ = 233.39
- GF = 96.06/233.39 = 0.4116
- Mass SO₄ = 0.5832 × 0.4116 = 0.2400 g
- % SO₄ = (0.2400/0.7500) × 100 = 32.00%
