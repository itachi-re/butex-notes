## 1. Introduction to Solutions

### 1.1 Definition

**Solution:** A homogeneous mixture of two or more substances at the molecular or ionic level.

**Components:**
- **Solvent:** The substance present in greater amount (dissolving medium)
- **Solute:** The substance present in lesser amount (dissolved substance)

### 1.2 Types of Solutions

**By Physical State:**

| Solute | Solvent | Example | Name |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| Gas | Gas | Air (O₂ in N₂) | Gaseous solution |
| Liquid | Gas | Water vapor in air | Gaseous solution |
| Solid | Gas | Iodine vapor in air | Gaseous solution |
| Gas | Liquid | CO₂ in water | Liquid solution |
| Liquid | Liquid | Ethanol in water | Liquid solution |
| Solid | Liquid | Sugar in water | Liquid solution |
| Gas | Solid | H₂ in palladium | Solid solution |
| Liquid | Solid | Mercury in gold | Solid solution |
| Solid | Solid | Copper in gold (alloy) | Solid solution |

### 1.3 Concentration Units

**Molarity (M):**
```
M = moles of solute / liters of solution
Units: mol/L or M
```

**Molality (m):**
```
m = moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
Units: mol/kg or m
```

**Mole Fraction (X):**
```
Xsolute = moles of solute / total moles
Xsolvent = moles of solvent / total moles
Xsolute + Xsolvent = 1
```

**Mass Percent:**
```
Mass% = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 100%
```

**Parts Per Million (ppm):**
```
ppm = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 10⁶
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Molarity:** Volume-dependent (changes with temperature)
- **Molality:** Mass-dependent (independent of temperature)
- **For colligative properties:** Molality preferred

## 2. Dilute Solutions

### 2.1 Definition

**Dilute Solution:** A solution in which the amount of solute is very small compared to the amount of solvent.

**Characteristics:**
- Approaches ideal solution behavior
- Obeys Raoult's law
- Heat and volume changes upon mixing are negligible
- Solute-solute interactions minimal
- Solute particles well separated

### 2.2 Ideal vs Non-Ideal Solutions

**Ideal Solutions:**
- Obey Raoult's law over entire concentration range
- ΔHmixing = 0 (no heat absorbed or released)
- ΔVmixing = 0 (no volume change)
- Solute-solvent interactions ≈ solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions

**Non-Ideal Solutions:**
- Deviate from Raoult's law
- ΔHmixing ≠ 0
- ΔVmixing ≠ 0
- Different intermolecular forces

**Examples of Near-Ideal Solutions:**
- Benzene and toluene
- Hexane and heptane
- Chlorobenzene and bromobenzene

### 2.3 Importance of Dilute Solutions

**Why Study Dilute Solutions?**
1. **Simpler Behavior:** More predictable properties
2. **Practical Relevance:** Many natural and industrial processes
3. **Biological Systems:** Body fluids are dilute solutions
4. **Foundation:** Understanding leads to more complex systems

---

## 3. Raoult's Law

### 3.1 Statement and Formula

**Raoult's Law (1886):** The vapor pressure of a solvent above a solution is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution.

**Mathematical Expression:**
```
P₁ = X₁ × P₁°

Where:
P₁ = vapor pressure of solvent above solution
X₁ = mole fraction of solvent in solution
P₁° = vapor pressure of pure solvent
```

### 3.2 Assumptions

**Valid When:**
1. Solution is dilute
2. Solute is non-volatile (negligible vapor pressure)
3. Solute does not dissolve in solid solvent
4. No chemical reaction between solute and solvent

### 3.3 Derivation and Understanding

**For Binary Solution (one solvent, one solute):**

```
Mole fraction of solvent: X₁ = N/(N + n)
Mole fraction of solute: X₂ = n/(N + n)

Where:
N = moles of solvent
n = moles of solute

Since X₁ + X₂ = 1:
X₁ = 1 - X₂

Therefore:
P₁ = (1 - X₂) × P₁°
P₁ = P₁° - X₂P₁°
```

**Lowering of Vapor Pressure:**
```
ΔP = P₁° - P₁
ΔP = P₁° - X₁P₁°
ΔP = P₁°(1 - X₁)
ΔP = P₁° × X₂
```

**Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure:**
```
ΔP/P₁° = (P₁° - P₁)/P₁° = X₂

This equals the mole fraction of the solute!
```

### 3.4 Physical Basis

**Why Does Vapor Pressure Decrease?**

1. **Surface Coverage:**
   - Pure solvent: Entire surface covered by solvent molecules
   - Solution: Surface has both solvent and solute molecules
   - Fewer solvent molecules at surface → lower vapor pressure

2. **Entropy Effect:**
   - Solvent in solution has higher entropy (more disorder)
   - Less driving force to escape into vapor phase
   - Reduced tendency to evaporate

3. **Thermodynamic View:**
   - Chemical potential of solvent lowered by presence of solute
   - Vapor pressure adjusts to maintain equilibrium

## 4. Colligative Properties Overview

### 4.1 Definition

**Colligative Properties:** Properties of solutions that depend only on the number of solute particles present, not on their chemical identity.

**Etymology:** From Latin "colligatus" meaning "bound together"

**Introduced by:** Wilhelm Ostwald (1891)

### 4.2 Types of Properties

Ostwald classified solution properties into three categories:

**1. Colligative Properties:**
- Depend only on number of particles
- Independent of particle nature
- Examples: vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, osmotic pressure

**2. Additive Properties:**
- Sum of individual particle properties
- Depend on composition
- Examples: mass, volume

**3. Constitutive Properties:**
- Depend on molecular structure and arrangement
- Examples: color, refractive index, viscosity

### 4.3 Four Main Colligative Properties

| Property | Symbol | Effect | Application |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Vapor Pressure Lowering | ΔP | Decreases | Molar mass determination |
| Boiling Point Elevation | ΔTb | Increases | Antifreeze, cooking |
| Freezing Point Depression | ΔTf | Decreases | Road salt, ice cream making |
| Osmotic Pressure | π | Pressure develops | Biological systems, desalination |

### 4.4 Why "Colligative"?

All four properties are interconnected and arise from the same fundamental cause:
- Presence of solute particles disrupts solvent's pure state
- Changes equilibrium between phases
- Effect proportional to particle concentration

### 4.5 Limitations

**Colligative Properties Are Ideal Only for:**
- **Dilute solutions** (typically < 0.1 M)
- **Non-electrolytes** (or corrected for electrolytes)
- **Non-volatile solutes**

**At Higher Concentrations:**
- Solute-solute interactions become significant
- Properties depend on solute nature
- Deviations from ideal behavior

## 5. Vapor Pressure Lowering

### 5.1 Quantitative Treatment

**For Non-Volatile Solute:**

**Raoult's Law:**
```
P₁ = X₁P₁°
```

**Lowering:**
```
ΔP = P₁° - P₁ = P₁°X₂
```

**Relative Lowering:**
```
ΔP/P₁° = X₂ = n/(N + n)

For dilute solutions (n << N):
ΔP/P₁° ≈ n/N
```

### 5.2 Practical Expression

**In Terms of Molality:**

```
X₂ = n/(N + n)

For dilute solutions:
X₂ ≈ n/N = (w₂/M₂)/(W₁/M₁)

Where:
w₂ = mass of solute (g)
M₂ = molar mass of solute (g/mol)
W₁ = mass of solvent (g)
M₁ = molar mass of solvent (g/mol)

Therefore:
ΔP/P₁° = (w₂M₁)/(M₂W₁)
```

**Rearranging for Molar Mass:**
```
M₂ = (w₂M₁P₁°)/(W₁ΔP)
```

### 5.3 Determination of Molar Mass

**Method:**
1. Measure P₁° (pure solvent vapor pressure)
2. Measure P₁ (solution vapor pressure)
3. Calculate ΔP = P₁° - P₁
4. Know w₂, W₁, M₁
5. Calculate M₂

**Example Problem:**

10.0 g of a non-volatile solute dissolved in 100 g water lowers vapor pressure from 23.76 torr to 23.40 torr at 25°C.

Calculate molar mass of solute.

**Solution:**
```
ΔP = 23.76 - 23.40 = 0.36 torr
ΔP/P₁° = 0.36/23.76 = 0.0151

X₂ = 0.0151
n/(n + N) = 0.0151

N = 100/18 = 5.56 mol (water)

n/(n + 5.56) = 0.0151
n = 0.0151n + 0.0840
0.9849n = 0.0840
n = 0.0853 mol

M₂ = 10.0/0.0853 = 117 g/mol
```

## 6. Boiling Point Elevation

### 6.1 Phenomenon

**Normal Boiling Point:** Temperature at which vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

**Effect of Solute:**
- Vapor pressure lowered → Higher temperature needed to reach 1 atm
- Boiling point increases
- **ΔTb = Tb(solution) - Tb(pure solvent) > 0**

### 6.2 Quantitative Relationship

**Boiling Point Elevation:**
```
ΔTb = Kb × m × i

Where:
ΔTb = boiling point elevation (°C or K)
Kb = molal boiling point elevation constant (°C/m or K/m)
m = molality of solution (mol/kg)
i = van't Hoff factor (for non-electrolytes, i = 1)
```

### 6.3 Molal Boiling Point Constant (Kb)

**Ebullioscopic Constant:** Characteristic of the solvent

**Common Values:**

| Solvent | Kb (°C/m) | Normal Bp (°C) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Water | 0.512 | 100.0 |
| Benzene | 2.53 | 80.1 |
| Ethanol | 1.22 | 78.4 |
| Chloroform | 3.63 | 61.2 |
| Acetic acid | 3.07 | 118.1 |

**Theoretical Expression:**
```
Kb = (RT²M₁)/(1000 × ΔHvap)

Where:
R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)
T = boiling point (K)
M₁ = molar mass of solvent (g/mol)
ΔHvap = enthalpy of vaporization (J/mol)
```

### 6.4 Applications

**1. Molar Mass Determination:**

```
From ΔTb = Kb × m:

m = ΔTb/Kb = moles solute / kg solvent

If w₂ = mass of solute (g), W₁ = mass of solvent (kg):

m = (w₂/M₂)/W₁

Therefore:
M₂ = (Kb × w₂)/(ΔTb × W₁)
```

**2. Cooking Applications:**
- Salt water boils at higher temperature
- Pasta cooks slightly faster (minimal effect actually)
- Candy making relies on precise temperature control

**3. Antifreeze in Cooling Systems:**
- Ethylene glycol raises boiling point
- Prevents summer boil-over

**Example Problem:**

1.00 g naphthalene (C₁₀H₈) dissolved in 50.0 g benzene. Calculate boiling point of solution.

**Solution:**
```
M₂ (naphthalene) = 128 g/mol
n = 1.00/128 = 0.00781 mol
m = 0.00781/0.0500 = 0.156 m

ΔTb = Kb × m = 2.53 × 0.156 = 0.395°C

Tb(solution) = 80.1 + 0.395 = 80.5°C
```

## 7. Freezing Point Depression

### 7.1 Phenomenon

**Normal Freezing Point:** Temperature at which solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium at 1 atm.

**Effect of Solute:**
- Lowers chemical potential of solvent
- Solid phase (pure solvent) must be at lower temperature to achieve equilibrium
- Freezing point decreases
- **ΔTf = Tf(pure solvent) - Tf(solution) > 0**

### 7.2 Quantitative Relationship

**Freezing Point Depression:**
```
ΔTf = Kf × m × i

Where:
ΔTf = freezing point depression (°C or K)
Kf = molal freezing point depression constant (°C/m or K/m)
m = molality of solution (mol/kg)
i = van't Hoff factor
```

### 7.3 Molal Freezing Point Constant (Kf)

**Cryoscopic Constant:** Characteristic of the solvent

**Common Values:**

| Solvent | Kf (°C/m) | Normal Fp (°C) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Water | 1.86 | 0.0 |
| Benzene | 5.12 | 5.5 |
| Acetic acid | 3.90 | 16.6 |
| Camphor | 37.7 | 178.4 |
| Cyclohexane | 20.0 | 6.5 |

**Theoretical Expression:**
```
Kf = (RT²M₁)/(1000 × ΔHfusion)

Where:
R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)
T = freezing point (K)
M₁ = molar mass of solvent (g/mol)
ΔHfusion = enthalpy of fusion (J/mol)
```

**Note:** Kf generally larger than Kb (ΔHfusion < ΔHvap)

### 7.4 Applications

**1. Molar Mass Determination:**

Most accurate colligative property method because:
- Kf values are large → large, measurable effects
- Temperatures easily controlled and measured
- Especially useful for camphor (very large Kf = 37.7°C/m)

```
M₂ = (Kf × w₂)/(ΔTf × W₁)
```

**2. Antifreeze (Engine Coolant):**
- Ethylene glycol (C₂H₆O₂) lowers freezing point
- Protects against winter freezing
- 50% solution: -37°C freezing point

**Calculation Example:**
What mass of ethylene glycol per kg of water lowers freezing point to -10.0°C?

**Solution:**
```
ΔTf = 10.0°C
Kf = 1.86°C/m
i = 1 (molecular compound)

m = ΔTf/(Kf × i) = 10.0/(1.86 × 1) = 5.38 mol/kg

M₂ = 62.07 g/mol (C₂H₆O₂)
Mass = 5.38 × 62.07 = 334 g per kg water
```

**3. Road De-icing:**
- Rock salt (NaCl) lowers freezing point of ice
- i = 2 for NaCl (ideal)
- CaCl₂ more effective (i = 3)
- Eutectic: NaCl-ice mixture: -21°C
- CaCl₂-ice mixture: -55°C

**4. Ice Cream Making:**
- Salt-ice mixture creates temperature below 0°C
- Allows ice cream to freeze
- Typically reaches -15 to -20°C

**5. Biological Systems:**
- Antifreeze proteins in fish (Arctic/Antarctic)
- Sugar content in tree sap prevents freezing
- Glycerol in insect hemolymph

## 8. Osmotic Pressure

### 8.1 Osmosis Phenomenon

**Osmosis:** Net movement of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration (higher solvent concentration) to a region of higher solute concentration (lower solvent concentration).

**Semipermeable Membrane:**
- Allows passage of solvent molecules
- Prevents passage of solute particles
- Examples: cellophane, parchment paper, cell membranes

### 8.2 Osmotic Pressure Definition

**Osmotic Pressure (π):** The hydrostatic pressure that must be applied to the solution to prevent osmosis (stop net solvent flow).

**Physical Setup:**
```
Pure Solvent | Membrane | Solution
    ← ← ← (solvent flow)
    
Apply pressure π →
    
Equilibrium: No net flow
```

**Direction of Osmosis:**
- Solvent always flows toward more concentrated solution
- Continues until equilibrium (equal chemical potentials)
- Or until hydrostatic pressure balances osmotic pressure

### 8.3 Van't Hoff Equation

**Osmotic Pressure Formula:**
```
π = i × M × R × T

or

π = i × (n/V) × R × T = i × C × R × T

Where:
π = osmotic pressure (atm or Pa)
i = van't Hoff factor
M or C = molarity of solution (mol/L)
n = moles of solute
V = volume of solution (L)
R = 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K) or 8.314 J/(mol·K)
T = absolute temperature (K)
```

**Alternative Forms:**
```
π = (w₂RT)/(M₂V)

For dilute solutions:
πV = nRT (resembles ideal gas law!)
```

### 8.4 Laws of Osmotic Pressure

**Discovered by Pfeffer (botanist) and van't Hoff (chemist):**

**1. Concentration Law:**
Osmotic pressure is directly proportional to molarity at constant temperature.
```
π ∝ C (at constant T)
```

**2. Temperature Law:**
Osmotic pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature at constant concentration.
```
π ∝ T (at constant C)
```

**Combined:** π = CRT (van't Hoff equation)

### 8.5 Isotonic, Hypertonic, and Hypotonic Solutions

**Relative Osmotic Pressures:**

**1. Isotonic Solutions:**
- Equal osmotic pressures (π₁ = π₂)
- No net osmosis across membrane
- Examples:
  - 0.9% NaCl solution (physiological saline)
  - Blood cells in isotonic saline: no change

**2. Hypertonic Solution:**
- Higher osmotic pressure than reference
- Water flows OUT of cells into solution
- Cells shrink (crenation in RBCs)
- Example: Salt water vs fresh water fish

**3. Hypotonic Solution:**
- Lower osmotic pressure than reference
- Water flows INTO cells from solution
- Cells swell and may burst (hemolysis in RBCs)
- Example: Distilled water

**Biological Importance:**
- IV fluids must be isotonic with blood
- Cell survival depends on osmotic balance
- Plasmolysis in plant cells (hypertonic)
- Turgor pressure in plant cells (hypotonic)

### 8.6 Advantages for Molar Mass Determination

**Osmotic Pressure Method Most Accurate:**

**Reasons:**
1. **Large, measurable effect even at low concentrations**
   - π can be measured accurately
   - Other colligative properties give tiny changes

2. **Room temperature measurements**
   - No heating required
   - Biomolecules remain stable
   - No denaturation

3. **Particularly useful for:**
   - Polymers (large molecules)
   - Proteins and other biomolecules
   - Colloids

**Comparison of Sensitivities:**

For 0.01 M solution in water at 25°C:
- ΔTf ≈ 0.02°C (hard to measure accurately)
- ΔTb ≈ 0.005°C (very hard to measure)
- π ≈ 0.25 atm = 190 mmHg (easy to measure!)

**Formula for Molar Mass:**
```
From π = (w₂RT)/(M₂V):

M₂ = (w₂RT)/(πV)
```

**Example Problem:**

2.00 g protein dissolved in water to make 100 mL solution. Osmotic pressure = 0.021 atm at 25°C. Find molar mass.

**Solution:**
```
π = 0.021 atm
V = 0.100 L
T = 298 K
R = 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K)
w₂ = 2.00 g

M₂ = (w₂RT)/(πV)
M₂ = (2.00 × 0.08206 × 298)/(0.021 × 0.100)
M₂ = 48.9/0.0021
M₂ = 23,300 g/mol = 23.3 kg/mol
```

### 8.7 Reverse Osmosis

**Principle:**
Apply pressure greater than osmotic pressure to force solvent from solution through membrane.

**Result:**
- Solvent forced out
- Solute retained
- Concentration increases

**Applications:**

**1. Desalination (Seawater → Fresh Water):**
- Apply pressure > π of seawater
- Fresh water extracted
- Salt retained
- Major source of drinking water in arid regions

**Typical Values:**
- Seawater: π ≈ 25-30 atm
- Applied pressure: 50-80 atm
- Efficiency: 40-50% water recovery

**2. Water Purification:**
- Home RO systems
- Removes: bacteria, viruses, dissolved solids, heavy metals
- Produces ultra-pure water

**3. Food Industry:**
- Concentrating fruit juices
- Dairy products concentration
- Maple syrup production

**4. Medical Applications:**
- Kidney dialysis (hemodialysis)
- Drug purification

## 9. Van't Hoff Factor (i)

### 9.1 Introduction

**Problem:** Original colligative property equations work for non-electrolytes but fail for electrolytes.

**Reason:** Electrolytes dissociate into ions, producing more particles than expected from formula.

**Solution:** Van't Hoff introduced factor "i" to account for dissociation/association.

### 9.2 Definition

**Van't Hoff Factor (i):**
```
i = (Actual number of particles in solution) / (Number of formula units dissolved)

or

i = (Observed colligative property) / (Calculated colligative property for non-electrolyte)
```

**Modified Equations:**
```
ΔP = i × X₂ × P₁°
ΔTb = i × Kb × m
ΔTf = i × Kf × m
π = i × M × R × T
```

### 9.3 Theoretical Values

**For Non-Electrolytes:**
```
i = 1

Examples:
Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) → C₆H₁₂O₆ (no dissociation)
Urea (CH₄N₂O) → CH₄N₂O
Sucrose → Sucrose
```

**For Electrolytes:**
```
i = number of ions from complete dissociation

Examples:
NaCl → Na⁺ + Cl⁻        i = 2
CaCl₂ → Ca²⁺ + 2Cl⁻     i = 3
Al₂(SO₄)₃ → 2Al³⁺ + 3SO₄²⁻   i = 5
K₃PO₄ → 3K⁺ + PO₄³⁻     i = 4
```

### 9.4 Observed vs Theoretical Values

**Reality:** Observed i often less than theoretical

**Reasons for Deviation:**

**1. Incomplete Dissociation:**
- Weak electrolytes don't fully dissociate
- Example: CH₃COOH partially ionizes

**2. Ion Pairing:**
- Cations and anions associate
- Especially in concentrated solutions
- Reduces effective number of particles

**3. Ionic Atmosphere:**
- Each ion surrounded by opposite charge
- Reduces effective concentration

**Examples of Observed i:**

| Compound | Theoretical i | Observed i (0.1 M) |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| NaCl | 2 | 1.87-1.94 |
| MgSO₄ | 2 | 1.21-1.53 |
| K₂SO₄ | 3 | 2.32-2.70 |
| CaCl₂ | 3 | 2.47-2.78 |

**Trends:**
- Dilute solutions → i closer to theoretical
- Concentrated solutions → i significantly lower
- Higher charges → greater deviation (ion pairing)

### 9.5 Determining i Experimentally

**Method:** Measure any colligative property

**Example using Freezing Point Depression:**

0.100 m NaCl solution freezes at -0.348°C. Calculate i.

**Solution:**
```
ΔTf = 0.348°C
Kf = 1.86°C/m
m = 0.100 m

From ΔTf = i × Kf × m:
i = ΔTf/(Kf × m)
i = 0.348/(1.86 × 0.100)
i = 1.87

Theoretical i = 2
Observed i = 1.87 (93.5% dissociation)
```

### 9.6 Applications

**1. Determining Degree of Dissociation (α):**

For electrolyte producing n ions:
```
i = 1 + (n - 1)α

Where α = fraction dissociated

Solving for α:
α = (i - 1)/(n - 1)
```

**Example:** For NaCl (n = 2):
```
If i = 1.87:
α = (1.87 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 0.87 = 87% dissociated
```

**2. Determining Molecular Association:**

For compounds that associate (like carboxylic acids in benzene):
```
i < 1

Example: Acetic acid dimers in benzene
2CH₃COOH ⇌ (CH₃COOH)₂
i ≈ 0.5-0.7 depending on concentration
```

## Summary and Key Takeaways

### Fundamental Concepts:

**1. Raoult's Law:**
```
P₁ = X₁P₁°
ΔP/P₁° = X₂
```
- Basis for understanding colligative properties
- Valid for ideal dilute solutions

**2. Colligative Properties Depend Only on Particle Number:**

### Problem-Solving Strategy:

**General Approach:**
1. Identify which colligative property involved
2. Determine if electrolyte (find i)
3. Choose appropriate equation
4. Check units carefully

- Temperature units (always use Kelvin for π)
- Sign conventions (ΔTf and ΔTb are always positive)

### Comparison of Colligative Properties:

| Property | Best For | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Vapor Pressure | Volatile solvents | Direct measurement | Requires vapor pressure measurement |
| Boiling Point | Small molecules | Easy measurement | Small ΔTb values |
