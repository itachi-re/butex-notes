## 1. Introduction

Acids and bases are fundamental chemical substances that play crucial roles in chemistry, biology, and everyday life. Multiple theories have been developed to explain their behavior, each expanding upon the previous one to encompass more chemical systems.

### 1.1 Evolution of Acid-Base Theories

The understanding of acids and bases has evolved through three major theories:
1. **Arrhenius Theory (1884):** Based on ions in aqueous solution
2. **Brønsted-Lowry Theory (1923):** Based on proton transfer
3. **Lewis Theory (1923):** Based on electron pair donation/acceptance

Each theory builds upon and expands the scope of the previous one.

## 2. Arrhenius Theory

### 2.1 Definition

Proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1884, this was the first modern theory of acids and bases.

**Arrhenius Acid:**
- A substance that dissociates in water to produce hydrogen ions (H⁺) or hydronium ions (H₃O⁺)
- General equation: HA(aq) → H⁺(aq) + A⁻(aq)

**Arrhenius Base:**
- A substance that dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻)
- General equation: BOH(aq) → B⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

### 2.2 Examples

**Acids:**
- HCl(aq) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)
- H₂SO₄(aq) → 2H⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq)
- HNO₃(aq) → H⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq)

**Bases:**
- NaOH(aq) → Na⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
- KOH(aq) → K⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
- Ca(OH)₂(aq) → Ca²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq)

### 2.3 Neutralization Reaction

Acid + Base → Salt + Water
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)

### 2.4 Limitations

1. **Water requirement:** Only applies to aqueous solutions
2. **OH⁻ requirement for bases:** Cannot explain basic substances without hydroxide ions (e.g., NH₃, Na₂CO₃)
3. **Non-aqueous reactions:** Cannot explain acid-base reactions in other solvents or gas phase
4. **Neutral salts:** Cannot explain why some salts are acidic or basic (e.g., ZnCl₂, Na₂S)

## 3. Brønsted-Lowry Theory

### 3.1 Definition

Independently proposed by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted (Denmark) and Thomas Martin Lowry (England) in 1923.

**Brønsted-Lowry Acid:**
- A proton (H⁺) donor
- Must contain hydrogen that can be donated

**Brønsted-Lowry Base:**
- A proton (H⁺) acceptor
- Must have a lone pair of electrons to accept proton

### 3.2 General Equation

Acid₁ + Base₂ ⇌ Base₁ + Acid₂

HA + B ⇌ A⁻ + HB⁺

### 3.3 Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs

When an acid donates a proton, it forms its conjugate base. When a base accepts a proton, it forms its conjugate acid.

**Example 1:**
HCl(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)
- Acid₁: HCl, Conjugate Base₁: Cl⁻
- Base₂: H₂O, Conjugate Acid₂: H₃O⁺

**Example 2:**
NH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
- Base₁: NH₃, Conjugate Acid₁: NH₄⁺
- Acid₂: H₂O, Conjugate Base₂: OH⁻

**Example 3 (Gas Phase):**
NH₃(g) + HCl(g) → NH₄Cl(s)
- Acid: HCl, Base: NH₃

### 3.4 Amphoteric Substances

Substances that can act as both acids and bases depending on the reaction conditions.

**Water is amphoteric:**
- As base: HCl + H₂O → H₃O⁺ + Cl⁻
- As acid: NH₃ + H₂O → NH₄⁺ + OH⁻

**Other amphoteric species:**
- HSO₄⁻, H₂PO₄⁻, HCO₃⁻, HS⁻
- Amino acids (contain both -NH₂ and -COOH groups)

### 3.5 Autoionization of Water

2H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

Or simplified: H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

**Ion Product of Water (Kw):**
Kw = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C

### 3.6 Strengths of Conjugate Pairs

**Important Principle:**
- Strong acids have weak conjugate bases
- Weak acids have strong conjugate bases
- Strong bases have weak conjugate acids
- Weak bases have strong conjugate acids

**Example:**
- HCl (strong acid) → Cl⁻ (very weak base, no tendency to accept H⁺)
- CH₃COOH (weak acid) → CH₃COO⁻ (relatively strong base)

### 3.7 Advantages Over Arrhenius Theory

1. Applies to non-aqueous solutions
2. Applies to gas phase reactions
3. Explains basic substances without OH⁻ (e.g., NH₃)
4. Introduces concept of conjugate pairs
5. More general and predictive

## 4. Lewis Theory

### 4.1 Definition

Proposed by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, the same year as Brønsted-Lowry theory.

**Lewis Acid:**
- An electron pair acceptor
- Has empty orbitals to accept electrons
- Does not need to contain hydrogen

**Lewis Base:**
- An electron pair donor
- Has lone pairs of electrons to donate

### 4.2 General Representation

A + :B → A:B

Where A = Lewis acid, :B = Lewis base (colon represents lone pair)

### 4.3 Examples

**Example 1: BF₃ and NH₃**
BF₃ + :NH₃ → F₃B:NH₃
- BF₃ is Lewis acid (has empty orbital on B)
- NH₃ is Lewis base (has lone pair on N)

**Example 2: Metal Ion Complexation**
Fe³⁺ + 6H₂O → [Fe(H₂O)₆]³⁺
- Fe³⁺ is Lewis acid (accepts electron pairs)
- H₂O is Lewis base (donates electron pairs)

**Example 3: AlCl₃ and Cl⁻**
AlCl₃ + Cl⁻ → AlCl₄⁻
- AlCl₃ is Lewis acid
- Cl⁻ is Lewis base

**Example 4: H⁺ and OH⁻**
H⁺ + :OH⁻ → H:OH (H₂O)
- H⁺ is Lewis acid (electron acceptor)
- OH⁻ is Lewis base (electron donor)

### 4.4 Relationship to Other Theories

**Hierarchy:**
- All Arrhenius acids/bases are Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases
- All Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases are Lewis acids/bases
- BUT: Not all Lewis acids/bases are Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases

**Examples of Lewis acids that are NOT Brønsted-Lowry acids:**
- BF₃, AlCl₃, FeCl₃ (no hydrogen to donate)
- Metal cations: Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺

### 4.5 Applications

1. **Coordination Chemistry:** All metal-ligand complexes are Lewis acid-base reactions
2. **Organic Chemistry:** Many reactions (nucleophilic substitution, addition)
3. **Catalysis:** Lewis acids used as catalysts (AlCl₃ in Friedel-Crafts reactions)
4. **Solid State Chemistry:** Formation of ionic compounds

### 4.6 Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) Theory

An extension of Lewis theory that classifies acids and bases as "hard" or "soft":

**Hard Acids:** Small, highly charged, low polarizability (H⁺, Li⁺, Fe³⁺)
**Soft Acids:** Large, low charge, high polarizability (Cu⁺, Ag⁺, Hg²⁺)

**Hard Bases:** Small, high electronegativity, low polarizability (F⁻, OH⁻, NH₃)
**Soft Bases:** Large, low electronegativity, high polarizability (I⁻, RS⁻, PR₃)

**Principle:** Hard acids prefer hard bases, soft acids prefer soft bases.

## 5. Acid-Base Strength

### 5.1 Strong Acids and Bases

**Strong Acids (Complete Dissociation):**
- HCl, HBr, HI
- HNO₃
- H₂SO₄ (first proton)
- HClO₄

**Strong Bases (Complete Dissociation):**
- Group 1 hydroxides: LiOH, NaOH, KOH
- Group 2 hydroxides: Ca(OH)₂, Sr(OH)₂, Ba(OH)₂

### 5.2 Weak Acids and Bases

**Weak Acids (Partial Dissociation):**
- CH₃COOH (acetic acid), Ka = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵
- HF (hydrofluoric acid), Ka = 6.8 × 10⁻⁴
- H₂CO₃ (carbonic acid), Ka1 = 4.3 × 10⁻⁷
- H₃PO₄ (phosphoric acid), Ka1 = 7.5 × 10⁻³

**Weak Bases (Partial Dissociation):**
- NH₃ (ammonia), Kb = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵
- CH₃NH₂ (methylamine), Kb = 4.4 × 10⁻⁴
- Pyridine, Kb = 1.7 × 10⁻⁹

### 5.3 Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka)

For weak acid HA:
HA(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + A⁻(aq)

Ka = [H₃O⁺][A⁻] / [HA]

**Larger Ka → Stronger acid**

### 5.4 Base Dissociation Constant (Kb)

For weak base B:
B(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ BH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

Kb = [BH⁺][OH⁻] / [B]

**Larger Kb → Stronger base**

### 5.5 Relationship Between Ka and Kb

For conjugate acid-base pair:
Ka × Kb = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)

pKa + pKb = pKw = 14.00 (at 25°C)

---

## 6. pH and pOH Scales

### 6.1 Definitions

**pH (Power of Hydrogen):**
pH = -log[H⁺] = -log[H₃O⁺]

**pOH:**
pOH = -log[OH⁻]

**pKa:**
pKa = -log Ka

**pKb:**
pKb = -log Kb

### 6.2 pH Scale

- pH < 7: Acidic solution
- pH = 7: Neutral solution (at 25°C)
- pH > 7: Basic solution

### 6.3 Relationship Between pH and pOH

pH + pOH = 14.00 (at 25°C)

### 6.4 Calculating pH

**For Strong Acid:**
pH = -log[H⁺]

**For Strong Base:**
pOH = -log[OH⁻], then pH = 14 - pOH

**For Weak Acid:**
Use Ka expression and solve (may require quadratic equation or approximations)

**For Weak Base:**
Use Kb expression and solve

### 6.5 Examples

**Example 1:** Calculate pH of 0.01 M HCl
- HCl is strong acid: [H⁺] = 0.01 M
- pH = -log(0.01) = 2.00

**Example 2:** Calculate pH of 0.01 M NaOH
- NaOH is strong base: [OH⁻] = 0.01 M
- pOH = -log(0.01) = 2.00
- pH = 14 - 2 = 12.00

## 7. Buffer Solutions

### 7.1 Definition

A buffer solution is an aqueous solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, or when diluted.

### 7.2 Composition

**Two Types:**

**Acidic Buffer:**
- Weak acid + its conjugate base (salt)
- Example: CH₃COOH + CH₃COONa (acetic acid/acetate buffer)
- pH < 7

**Basic Buffer:**
- Weak base + its conjugate acid (salt)
- Example: NH₃ + NH₄Cl (ammonia/ammonium buffer)
- pH > 7

### 7.3 How Buffers Work

**Addition of H⁺:**
- Conjugate base neutralizes added acid
- A⁻ + H⁺ → HA

**Addition of OH⁻:**
- Weak acid neutralizes added base
- HA + OH⁻ → A⁻ + H₂O

The buffer components work together to minimize pH change.

### 7.4 Buffer Capacity

**Definition:** The amount of acid or base a buffer can neutralize before its pH changes significantly.

**Factors Affecting Buffer Capacity:**
1. **Concentration:** Higher concentrations → Higher capacity
2. **Ratio:** Best capacity when [A⁻]/[HA] ≈ 1

### 7.5 Buffer Range

The effective pH range of a buffer is typically: **pKa ± 1**

- For acetic acid buffer (pKa = 4.76): Effective range is pH 3.76 - 5.76
- Choose buffer with pKa close to desired pH

### 7.6 Biological Importance

**Blood Buffer System:**
- pH maintained at 7.35 - 7.45
- Primary buffer: H₂CO₃/HCO₃⁻ (carbonic acid/bicarbonate)
- H₂CO₃(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HCO₃⁻(aq)

**Acidosis:** Blood pH < 7.35 (causes nausea, headaches, potentially coma)
**Alkalosis:** Blood pH > 7.45

## 8. Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

### 8.1 Derivation and Formula

Developed by Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1908) and Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1909).

**For Acidic Buffer:**
pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

**For Basic Buffer:**
pOH = pKb + log([BH⁺]/[B])
Then: pH = 14 - pOH

### 8.2 Applications

1. Calculate pH of buffer solution
2. Determine buffer composition for desired pH
3. Calculate pH change when acid/base is added
4. Design buffer systems for experiments

### 8.3 Worked Examples

**Example 1:** Calculate pH of buffer containing 0.20 M CH₃COOH and 0.50 M CH₃COO⁻
(Ka = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵)

**Solution:**
- pKa = -log(1.8 × 10⁻⁵) = 4.74
- pH = 4.74 + log(0.50/0.20)
- pH = 4.74 + log(2.5)
- pH = 4.74 + 0.40
- pH = 5.14

**Example 2:** What ratio of NH₄Cl to NH₃ gives pOH = 5.00?
(Kb for NH₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵)

**Solution:**
- pKb = -log(1.8 × 10⁻⁵) = 4.74
- pOH = pKb + log([NH₄⁺]/[NH₃])
- 5.00 = 4.74 + log([NH₄⁺]/[NH₃])
- 0.26 = log([NH₄⁺]/[NH₃])
- [NH₄⁺]/[NH₃] = 10^0.26 = 1.82
- Ratio is approximately 1.8:1

**Example 3:** Calculate pH when 0.5 mol NaOH added to 1 L buffer of 3.0 M CH₃COOH and 3.0 M CH₃COO⁻

**Solution:**
- Reaction: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O
- After addition:
  - [CH₃COOH] = 3.0 - 0.5 = 2.5 M
  - [CH₃COO⁻] = 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5 M
- pH = 4.74 + log(3.5/2.5)
- pH = 4.74 + 0.15
- pH = 4.89

### 8.4 Limitations

1. **Assumes equilibrium concentrations ≈ initial concentrations**
   - Valid when dissociation is small (weak acids/bases)

2. **Not accurate for strong acids/bases**
   - Complete dissociation violates assumptions

3. **Not accurate at extreme dilution**
   - Water autoionization becomes significant

4. **Not accurate when pKa < 2.5 or pKb < 2.5**
   - Significant dissociation occurs

5. **Valid range:** 0.1 ≤ [A⁻]/[HA] ≤ 10 for best accuracy

## 9. Acid-Base Titrations

### 9.1 Definition

Titration is a quantitative analytical technique to determine the concentration of an acid or base by neutralization with a standard solution of base or acid.

### 9.2 Types of Titrations

1. **Strong Acid - Strong Base** (e.g., HCl + NaOH)
2. **Weak Acid - Strong Base** (e.g., CH₃COOH + NaOH)
3. **Strong Acid - Weak Base** (e.g., HCl + NH₃)
4. **Weak Acid - Weak Base** (Not commonly used - difficult endpoint)

### 9.3 Titration Curves

**Key Points:**
- **Initial pH:** Depends on starting solution
- **Buffer Region:** Flat region where pH changes slowly
- **Equivalence Point:** Where moles acid = moles base
- **Endpoint:** Where indicator changes color

### 9.4 Equivalence Point pH

- **Strong Acid + Strong Base:** pH = 7.00
- **Weak Acid + Strong Base:** pH > 7 (excess conjugate base)
- **Strong Acid + Weak Base:** pH < 7 (excess conjugate acid)

### 9.5 Indicators

Chemical compounds that change color at specific pH ranges.

**Common Indicators:**
- Phenolphthalein: Colorless (pH < 8.2) → Pink (pH > 10.0)
- Methyl orange: Red (pH < 3.1) → Yellow (pH > 4.4)
- Bromothymol blue: Yellow (pH < 6.0) → Blue (pH > 7.6)

**Selection:** Choose indicator whose transition range includes the equivalence point pH.
