## 📝 Key Equations Reference

### Chemical Kinetics:
```
Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n
ln[A]t = ln[A]0 - kt (first order)
k = Ae^(-Ea/RT) (Arrhenius equation)
```

### Chemical Equilibrium:
```
Kc = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b
Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn
ln(K2/K1) = -(ΔH°/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1)
```

### Colligative Properties:
```
ΔP = X2 × P1°
ΔTb = Kb × m × i
ΔTf = Kf × m × i
π = i × M × R × T
```

### Colloid Chemistry:
```
Zeta potential (ζ)
Hardy-Schulze rule: Power ∝ (valence)^6
Stokes' law: v = 2r²(ρp - ρm)g/(9η)
```
