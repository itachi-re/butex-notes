## 1. Introduction to Coordination Chemistry

### 1.1 Definition and Historical Context

Coordination chemistry focuses on compounds containing one or more metal centers bound to surrounding molecules or ions called ligands. This field formally emerged in the late 19th century through the pioneering work of Alfred Werner, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913 as the first inorganic chemist to win this honor.

**Key Historical Milestone:** The first coordination compound, Prussian Blue, was accidentally discovered in 1704 by a Berlin color maker during the heating of animal waste with sodium carbonate in an iron container.

### 1.2 Basic Concepts

**Coordination Compound:** A complex substance consisting of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by molecules or ions (ligands) that are coordinately bonded to it.

**Complex Ion:** When a coordination compound carries an electric charge, it is called a complex ion. For example, [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is a complex ion with a positive charge.

**Coordination Sphere:** The central metal atom/ion and the ligands directly bonded to it, typically represented within square brackets [ ].

## 2. Werner's Theory

### 2.1 Primary and Secondary Valencies

Alfred Werner proposed in 1893 that metal ions exhibit two types of valencies:

**Primary Valence (Ionizable):**
- Equals the oxidation state of the metal
- Satisfied by negative ions
- Non-directional in nature
- Example: In [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃, Co has primary valence of +3

**Secondary Valence (Non-ionizable):**
- Equals the coordination number
- The number of atoms directly bonded to the central metal
- Directional in nature (determines geometry)
- Can be satisfied by neutral or charged ligands
- Example: In [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃, Co has secondary valence of 6

### 2.2 Coordination Number

The coordination number is the total number of coordinate bonds formed between the central metal and its surrounding ligands. Common coordination numbers include:

- **CN = 2:** Linear geometry (e.g., [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺)
- **CN = 4:** Tetrahedral or square planar (e.g., [Ni(CO)₄], [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂])
- **CN = 6:** Octahedral (most common) (e.g., [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻, [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺)

**Important Note:** For monodentate ligands, coordination number equals the number of ligands. For polydentate ligands, it equals the total number of donor atoms.

## 3. Ligands and Their Classification

### 3.1 Definition

Ligands are atoms, ions, or molecules that donate electron pairs to the central metal ion through coordination (coordinate covalent bonds). They act as Lewis bases while the metal center acts as a Lewis acid.

### 3.2 Classification by Denticity

**Monodentate Ligands (Denticity = 1)**
- Donate one electron pair through a single donor atom
- Examples:
  - H₂O (aqua)
  - NH₃ (ammine)
  - Cl⁻ (chloro)
  - CN⁻ (cyano)
  - CO (carbonyl)

**Bidentate Ligands (Denticity = 2)**
- Have two donor atoms
- Form one chelate ring
- Examples:
  - Ethylenediamine (en): H₂N-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂
  - Oxalate ion (ox): C₂O₄²⁻
  - Acetylacetonate (acac)

**Polydentate Ligands (Denticity > 2)**
- Have multiple donor atoms
- Examples:
  - EDTA⁴⁻ (Ethylenediamine tetraacetate): Denticity = 6, Forms 5 chelate rings
  - EDTA³⁻: Denticity = 5, Forms 4 chelate rings
  - Trien (Triethylene tetramine): Denticity = 4, Forms 3 chelate rings
  - Terpyridine: Denticity = 3, Forms 2 chelate rings

### 3.3 Chelate Effect

**Definition:** Chelating ligands form significantly more stable complexes than analogous unidentate ligands. This enhanced stability is called the chelate effect.

**Explanation:** The stability arises from:
- Entropy considerations (fewer particles after complexation)
- Formation of ring structures
- Multiple points of attachment

### 3.4 Ambidentate Ligands

Ligands with two different donor atoms, but only one can coordinate at a time:
- **SCN⁻/NCS⁻:** Can coordinate through S (thiocyanato-S) or N (thiocyanato-N)
- **NO₂⁻/ONO⁻:** Can coordinate through N (nitro) or O (nitrito)
- **CN⁻/NC⁻:** Can coordinate through C or N

### 3.5 Flexidentate Ligands

Ligands that can change their denticity depending on the coordination environment and metal center.

### 3.6 π-Bonding Ligands

Some ligands form π-bonds with the metal center:

**π-Donor Ligands (Weak Field):**
- Have filled p or d orbitals
- Examples: I⁻, Br⁻, Cl⁻, F⁻, OH⁻
- Decrease crystal field splitting (Δ)

**π-Acceptor Ligands (Strong Field):**
- Have empty π* orbitals
- Examples: CN⁻, CO, NO⁺
- Increase crystal field splitting (Δ)

**Spectrochemical Series:**
I⁻ < Br⁻ < SCN⁻ < Cl⁻ < F⁻ < OH⁻ < ox²⁻ < H₂O < NCS⁻ < NH₃ < en < bpy < phen < CN⁻ < CO

## 4. Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds

### 4.1 Basic Rules (IUPAC)

1. **Cation before anion:** Name the cation first, then the anion
2. **Ligands before metal:** Within the coordination sphere, ligands are named before the metal
3. **Alphabetical order:** Ligands are listed alphabetically (prefixes like di-, tri- are ignored)
4. **Prefixes for ligand count:**
   - 2 = di-, 3 = tri-, 4 = tetra-, 5 = penta-, 6 = hexa-
   - For complex ligands: bis-, tris-, tetrakis-
5. **Anionic ligands:** End in -o (Cl⁻ = chloro, CN⁻ = cyano)
6. **Neutral ligands:** Use molecular name (exceptions: H₂O = aqua, NH₃ = ammine, CO = carbonyl)
7. **Metal oxidation state:** Roman numerals in parentheses
8. **Anionic complexes:** Metal name ends in -ate

### 4.2 Examples

- [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃: Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride
- [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]: Diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
- K₄[Fe(CN)₆]: Potassium hexacyanoferrate(II)
- [Cr(H₂O)₄Cl₂]Cl: Tetraaquadichlorochromium(III) chloride

## 5. Isomerism in Coordination Compounds

### 5.1 Structural Isomerism

**5.1.1 Linkage Isomerism**
- Occurs with ambidentate ligands
- Example: [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺ (nitro) vs [Co(NH₃)₅(ONO)]²⁺ (nitrito)

**5.1.2 Coordination Isomerism**
- Different ligands coordinated to different metal centers
- Example: [Co(NH₃)₆][Cr(CN)₆] vs [Cr(NH₃)₆][Co(CN)₆]

**5.1.3 Ionization Isomerism**
- Different ions in solution
- Example: [Co(NH₃)₅Br]SO₄ vs [Co(NH₃)₅SO₄]Br

**5.1.4 Hydrate Isomerism**
- Different positions of water molecules
- Example: [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃ vs [Cr(H₂O)₅Cl]Cl₂·H₂O

### 5.2 Stereoisomerism

**5.2.1 Geometrical Isomerism**

*Octahedral Complexes [MA₄B₂]:*
- **cis-isomer:** Two identical ligands adjacent (90° angle)
- **trans-isomer:** Two identical ligands opposite (180° angle)
- Example: cis-platin [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂] (anticancer drug) vs trans-platin

*Square Planar Complexes [MA₂B₂]:*
- cis and trans isomers possible
- Example: [Pt(NH₃)₂Cl₂]

**5.2.2 Optical Isomerism**
- Occurs in chiral complexes (non-superimposable mirror images)
- Example: [Co(en)₃]³⁺ exists as Δ and Λ enantiomers
- No plane of symmetry or center of inversion

## 6. Bonding Theories

### 6.1 Valence Bond Theory (VBT)

**Main Concepts:**
- Metal uses hybrid orbitals for bonding
- Ligands donate electron pairs to empty metal orbitals
- Predicts geometry based on hybridization

**Common Hybridizations:**
- sp: Linear (CN = 2)
- sp³: Tetrahedral (CN = 4)
- dsp²: Square planar (CN = 4)
- sp³d²: Octahedral (CN = 6)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot explain colors of complexes
- Cannot predict magnetic properties accurately
- Cannot explain spectrochemical series

## 7. Crystal Field Theory (CFT)

### 7.1 Basic Principles

Crystal Field Theory treats the metal-ligand interaction as purely electrostatic. Ligands are considered as point charges that create an electric field affecting the metal's d-orbitals.

### 7.2 d-Orbital Splitting

**In Free Metal Ion:**
- All five d-orbitals (dxy, dxz, dyz, dx²-y², dz²) are degenerate (same energy)

**In Octahedral Field:**
- Ligands approach along x, y, z axes
- d-orbitals split into two sets:
  - **t₂g (lower energy):** dxy, dxz, dyz (point between axes)
  - **eg (higher energy):** dx²-y², dz² (point directly at ligands)
- Energy difference: Δₒ (octahedral crystal field splitting parameter)

**Energy Relationship:**
- t₂g orbitals: -0.4Δₒ (relative to average)
- eg orbitals: +0.6Δₒ (relative to average)

**In Tetrahedral Field:**
- Ligands approach between axes
- Splitting pattern is reversed (opposite to octahedral)
- Energy difference: Δₜ ≈ (4/9)Δₒ
- e orbitals (dz², dx²-y²): lower energy
- t₂ orbitals (dxy, dxz, dyz): higher energy

**In Square Planar Field:**
- Derived from octahedral by removing two trans ligands
- dx²-y² has highest energy
- Order: dx²-y² > dxy > dz² > dxz, dyz

### 7.3 Factors Affecting Δ

1. **Nature of Ligand** (Spectrochemical Series)
   - Weak field ligands: Small Δ (I⁻, Br⁻, Cl⁻, F⁻)
   - Strong field ligands: Large Δ (CN⁻, CO, NO⁺)

2. **Oxidation State of Metal**
   - Higher oxidation state → Larger Δ

3. **Period of Metal**
   - 3d < 4d < 5d (Δ increases down the group)

4. **Nature of Metal Ion**
   - Different metals produce different Δ values

### 7.4 High Spin vs Low Spin Complexes

**Key Factor:** Comparison between Δ and Pairing Energy (P)

**High Spin (Weak Field):**
- When Δ < P
- Maximum unpaired electrons
- Occurs with weak field ligands
- Example: [FeF₆]³⁻ (d⁵, 5 unpaired electrons)

**Low Spin (Strong Field):**
- When Δ > P
- Minimum unpaired electrons
- Occurs with strong field ligands
- Example: [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻ (d⁵, 1 unpaired electron)

### 7.5 Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)

CFSE = [(number of electrons in t₂g) × (-0.4Δₒ)] + [(number of electrons in eg) × (+0.6Δₒ)] + Pairing Energy

**Applications:**
- Predicts stability of complexes
- Explains trends in ionic radii, hydration energies, lattice energies

### 7.6 Jahn-Teller Distortion

**Theorem:** A non-linear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo geometrical distortion to remove the degeneracy and lower the overall energy.

**Most Common in:**
- d⁹ configuration (Cu²⁺ complexes)
- High-spin d⁴ and low-spin d⁷

**Effect:** Octahedral complexes elongate or compress along z-axis

## 8. Ligand Field Theory (LFT)

### 8.1 Overview

Ligand Field Theory combines concepts from Crystal Field Theory and Molecular Orbital Theory, providing a more accurate description of metal-ligand bonding.

**Key Advancement:** Unlike CFT's purely electrostatic model, LFT considers covalent character in metal-ligand bonds through orbital overlap.

### 8.2 Molecular Orbital Approach

**Formation of Molecular Orbitals:**
- Metal d, s, and p orbitals combine with ligand orbitals
- Creates bonding, non-bonding, and anti-bonding molecular orbitals
- Ligand electrons occupy bonding MOs
- Metal electrons occupy non-bonding and sometimes anti-bonding MOs

**For Octahedral Complex:**
- 6 bonding MOs (mainly ligand character)
- 3 non-bonding MOs (t₂g, mainly metal d character)
- 2 anti-bonding MOs (eg*, mainly metal d character)

### 8.3 σ and π Bonding

**σ-Bonding:**
- All ligands form σ-bonds through donation to metal
- Ligand orbitals overlap with metal orbitals along bonding axis

**π-Bonding:**
- Some ligands can form π-bonds
- **π-Donors:** Decrease Δ (F⁻, Cl⁻, OH⁻)
- **π-Acceptors:** Increase Δ (CN⁻, CO)

### 8.4 Angular Overlap Model (AOM)

A parametric approach within LFT that assigns local σ and π bonding parameters to each metal-ligand interaction.

For octahedral complexes: Δₒ = 3eσ - 4eπ

Where eσ and eπ are σ and π bonding parameters.
