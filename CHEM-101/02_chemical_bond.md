## 1. Introduction to Chemical Bonding

A **chemical bond** is the attractive force that holds atoms or ions together in molecules, compounds, or crystals. Chemical bonds form when atoms interact to achieve more stable electron configurations, typically by filling their valence shells.

### Why Do Atoms Form Bonds?

- Atoms bond to achieve **noble gas configuration** (stable octet or duplet)
- Bonding lowers the potential energy of the system
- Most atoms are unstable alone and seek stability through bonding

### Types of Chemical Bonds

There are three primary types of chemical bonds:

1. **Ionic Bonds** - Transfer of electrons (metal + nonmetal)
2. **Covalent Bonds** - Sharing of electrons (nonmetal + nonmetal)
3. **Metallic Bonds** - Sea of delocalized electrons (metal + metal)

---

## 2. Ionic Bonding

### Definition

Ionic bonds form through the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract each other electrostatically.

### Formation of Ionic Bonds

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Electron Transfer**: A metal atom loses one or more valence electrons
2. **Cation Formation**: The metal becomes a positively charged cation
3. **Anion Formation**: A nonmetal gains electrons and becomes a negatively charged anion
4. **Electrostatic Attraction**: Opposite charges attract to form the ionic bond

**Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)**

```
Na (2,8,1) → Na⁺ (2,8) + e⁻
Cl (2,8,7) + e⁻ → Cl⁻ (2,8,8)

Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl (ionic compound)
```

### Characteristics of Ionic Compounds

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Physical State** | Solid at room temperature with crystalline structure |
| **Melting Point** | High (strong electrostatic forces) |
| **Boiling Point** | High |
| **Electrical Conductivity** | Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water (ions are free to move), but not when solid |
| **Solubility** | Generally soluble in polar solvents (water) |
| **Hardness** | Hard but brittle |

### Lattice Energy

Lattice energy is the amount of energy released when one mole of ionic compound forms from gaseous ions. Higher lattice energy indicates stronger ionic bonding.

**Factors affecting lattice energy:**
- **Charge of ions**: Higher charge = stronger attraction = higher lattice energy
- **Size of ions**: Smaller ions = closer proximity = higher lattice energy

$$
\text{Lattice Energy} \propto \frac{q_1 \times q_2}{r}
$$

Where:
- $q_1, q_2$ = charges on the ions
- $r$ = distance between ion centers (sum of ionic radii)

### Examples of Ionic Compounds

- **NaCl** (Sodium chloride - table salt)
- **MgO** (Magnesium oxide)
- **CaCl₂** (Calcium chloride)
- **K₂O** (Potassium oxide)
- **Al₂O₃** (Aluminum oxide)

## 3. Covalent Bonding

### Definition

Covalent bonds occur between non-metals through the sharing of electron pairs to achieve stable electron configurations.

### Formation of Covalent Bonds

**Mechanism:**
- Two atoms each contribute one or more electrons
- Shared electron pair(s) are attracted to both nuclei
- Atoms with similar electronegativities share electrons rather than transferring them

### Types of Covalent Bonds

#### Based on Number of Shared Electron Pairs:

1. **Single Bond**: One pair of electrons shared
   - Example: H—H in H₂
   - Notation: A—B

2. **Double Bond**: Two pairs of electrons shared
   - Example: O=O in O₂
   - Notation: A=B

3. **Triple Bond**: Three pairs of electrons shared
   - Example: N≡N in N₂
   - Notation: A≡B

#### Based on Electronegativity Difference:

1. **Nonpolar Covalent Bond**
   - Electrons shared equally
   - Occurs between identical atoms or atoms with similar electronegativity
   - Electronegativity difference (ΔEN) < 0.5
   - Example: H₂, Cl₂, O₂

2. **Polar Covalent Bond**
   - Electrons shared unequally due to electronegativity differences, creating partial positive and negative charges
   - Electronegativity difference (ΔEN) = 0.5 to 2.0
   - Example: H—Cl, H—O

### The Octet Rule

The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve eight electrons in their valence shell (except hydrogen, which follows the duplet rule with 2 electrons).

**Exceptions to the Octet Rule:**
- **Incomplete octets**: Be (4e⁻), B (6e⁻)
- **Expanded octets**: P, S, Cl (can have more than 8e⁻ in Period 3+)
- **Odd electron molecules**: NO, NO₂

### Characteristics of Covalent Compounds

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Physical State** | Can be solid, liquid, or gas |
| **Melting Point** | Generally lower than ionic compounds |
| **Boiling Point** | Lower than ionic compounds |
| **Electrical Conductivity** | Poor conductors in any state (electrically neutral molecules) |
| **Solubility** | Generally soluble in nonpolar solvents |
| **Hardness** | Variable (soft to hard) |

### Examples of Covalent Compounds

- **H₂O** (Water)
- **CO₂** (Carbon dioxide)
- **CH₄** (Methane)
- **NH₃** (Ammonia)
- **HCl** (Hydrogen chloride)

## 4. Metallic Bonding

### Definition

Metallic bonding occurs between metal atoms where valence electrons are delocalized over the entire metal structure, forming a "sea of electrons".

### The Electron Sea Model

**Key features:**
- Metal atoms lose valence electrons easily
- Electrons become delocalized and mobile
- Positively charged metal ions (cations) are held in fixed positions
- Mobile electrons attract all surrounding cations simultaneously
- This creates a strong, non-directional bond

**Visualization:**
```
    e⁻  e⁻     e⁻
 M⁺   M⁺   M⁺   e⁻
   e⁻   M⁺   M⁺
 M⁺  e⁻  M⁺   M⁺
```

### Characteristics of Metals

| Property | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Electrical Conductivity** | High due to delocalized electrons that move freely through the metal |
| **Thermal Conductivity** | High (mobile electrons transfer energy) |
| **Malleability** | Can be hammered into sheets; layers of atoms can slide without breaking bonds |
| **Ductility** | Can be drawn into wires |
| **Metallic Luster** | Shiny appearance (electrons reflect light) |
| **High Melting Point** | Variable (Mercury is liquid; Tungsten melts at 3422°C) |

### Factors Affecting Metallic Bond Strength

1. **Number of valence electrons**: More electrons = stronger bonding
2. **Size of metal cation**: Smaller cations = stronger attraction = stronger bond
3. **Charge of metal ion**: Higher charge = stronger electrostatic attraction

### Examples of Metallic Substances

- **Iron (Fe)**
- **Copper (Cu)**
- **Aluminum (Al)**
- **Gold (Au)**
- **Sodium (Na)**

## 5. Lewis Dot Structures

### Definition

Lewis dot structures are diagrams showing valence electrons as dots around element symbols, with bonding electrons shown as lines or pairs of dots between atoms.

### Rules for Drawing Lewis Structures

**Step 1: Count total valence electrons**
- Add valence electrons from all atoms
- For anions: add extra electrons
- For cations: subtract electrons

**Step 2: Arrange atoms**
- Least electronegative atom in center (except H)
- More electronegative atoms on outside
- Hydrogen is always terminal

**Step 3: Draw single bonds**
- Connect central atom to surrounding atoms
- Each bond = 2 electrons

**Step 4: Complete octets**
- Place remaining electrons as lone pairs
- Start with outer atoms, then central atom

**Step 5: Check and adjust**
- If central atom lacks octet, form multiple bonds
- Calculate formal charges if needed

### Examples of Lewis Structures

**Water (H₂O):**
```
    H—Ö—H
       ··
```

**Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):**
```
    O=C=O
    ·· ··
```

**Ammonia (NH₃):**
```
       H
       |
    H—N—H
       ··
```

### Formal Charge

Formal charge helps determine the most stable Lewis structure.

$$
\text{Formal Charge} = V - (L + \frac{B}{2})
$$

Where:
- $V$ = valence electrons in free atom
- $L$ = number of lone pair electrons
- $B$ = number of bonding electrons

**Rules:**
- Most stable structure has formal charges closest to zero
- Negative formal charges should be on more electronegative atoms
- Adjacent atoms should not have like charges

## 6. Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

### Electronegativity

Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.

**Electronegativity Scale (Pauling Scale):**
- **Fluorine (F)**: 4.0 (highest)
- **Oxygen (O)**: 3.5
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 3.0
- **Carbon (C)**: 2.5
- **Hydrogen (H)**: 2.1
- **Cesium (Cs)**: 0.7 (lowest)

**Trends in Periodic Table:**
- **Increases** left to right across a period
- **Decreases** down a group
- Most electronegative: upper right corner (F, O, N)
- Least electronegative: lower left corner (Fr, Cs)

### Bond Polarity

The difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) determines bond type:

| ΔEN Range | Bond Type | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0.0 - 0.4 | Nonpolar Covalent | Electrons shared equally |
| 0.5 - 1.7 | Polar Covalent | Electrons shared unequally, creating partial charges |
| 1.8 - 4.0 | Ionic | Electron transfer, ions formed |

### Dipole Moment

A **dipole moment** occurs in polar bonds where there is charge separation.

**Notation:**
- δ⁺ (delta positive) = partial positive charge
- δ⁻ (delta negative) = partial negative charge
- → arrow points toward more electronegative atom

**Example: HCl**
```
H—Cl
δ⁺→δ⁻
```

### Molecular Polarity

A molecule is polar if it has an asymmetric geometry with polar bonds that don't cancel out.

**Polar molecules:** H₂O, NH₃, HCl
**Nonpolar molecules:** CO₂, CH₄, CCl₄

## 7. VSEPR Theory and Molecular Geometry

### VSEPR Theory

The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory predicts molecular geometry based on electron pair repulsions around a central atom.

**Main Principles:**
1. Electron pairs repel each other
2. Electron pairs arrange to minimize repulsion
3. Lone pairs repel more than bonding pairs
4. Repulsion order: lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair

### AXₙEₘ Notation

A represents the central atom, X represents bonded atoms, and E represents lone electron pairs.

### Common Molecular Geometries

| Formula | Bonding Pairs | Lone Pairs | Geometry | Bond Angle | Example |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|---------|
| AX₂ | 2 | 0 | Linear | 180° | CO₂, BeF₂ |
| AX₃ | 3 | 0 | Trigonal Planar | 120° | BF₃ |
| AX₂E | 2 | 1 | Bent | <120° | SO₂ |
| AX₄ | 4 | 0 | Tetrahedral | 109.5° | CH₄ |
| AX₃E | 3 | 1 | Trigonal Pyramidal | <109.5° | NH₃ (107°) |
| AX₂E₂ | 2 | 2 | Bent | <109.5° | H₂O (104.5°) |
| AX₅ | 5 | 0 | Trigonal Bipyramidal | 90°, 120° | PCl₅ |
| AX₄E | 4 | 1 | Seesaw | <120°, <90° | SF₄ |
| AX₃E₂ | 3 | 2 | T-shaped | <90° | ClF₃ |
| AX₂E₃ | 2 | 3 | Linear | 180° | XeF₂ |
| AX₆ | 6 | 0 | Octahedral | 90° | SF₆ |
| AX₅E | 5 | 1 | Square Pyramidal | <90° | BrF₅ |
| AX₄E₂ | 4 | 2 | Square Planar | 90° | XeF₄ |

### How to Predict Molecular Shape

1. Draw the Lewis structure

## 10. Important Notes

> **Key Concept**: All chemical bonds involve electromagnetic forces between charged particles (nuclei and electrons).

> **Remember**: The type of bond formed depends primarily on the **electronegativity difference** between bonding atoms.

> **Octet Rule Exception**: Elements in Period 3 and beyond can have expanded octets due to available d-orbitals.

> **VSEPR Shortcut**: "Lone pairs push more" - Lone pairs occupy more space and cause greater repulsion than bonding pairs.

> **Polarity Rule**: A molecule can have polar bonds but still be nonpolar if the molecular geometry is symmetrical and dipoles cancel out.

> **Metallic Properties**: All metallic properties (conductivity, malleability, ductility, luster) arise from the mobility of delocalized electrons.

## 11. Practice Problems

### Problem 1
Draw the Lewis structure for CO₂ and determine if it is polar or nonpolar.

**Solution:**
- Lewis structure: O=C=O (linear)
- ΔEN(C-O) = 1.0 (polar bonds)
- Molecular geometry: Linear (symmetrical)
- **Result: Nonpolar molecule** (dipoles cancel)

### Problem 2
Predict the molecular geometry of NH₃.

**Solution:**
- Lewis structure shows N with 3 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair
- Electron geometry: Tetrahedral (AX₃E)
- Molecular geometry: **Trigonal pyramidal**
- Bond angle: ~107° (less than 109.5° due to lone pair repulsion)

### Problem 3
Which bond is more polar: N—H or O—H?

**Solution:**
- ΔEN(N-H) = |3.0 - 2.1| = 0.9
- ΔEN(O-H) = |3.5 - 2.1| = 1.4
- **Answer: O—H is more polar** (larger electronegativity difference)
