## 1. Introduction to Colloids {#introduction}

### 1.1 Definition

**Colloid (Colloidal Solution):** A heterogeneous mixture in which one substance (dispersed phase) is distributed in another substance (dispersion medium) as particles with dimensions between 1 nm and 1000 nm (1-1000 nanometers or 10⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁶ meters).

**Etymology:**
- From Greek "kolla" = glue
- Named by Thomas Graham (1861)
- Originally studied glue-like substances

### 1.2 Size Range and Comparison

**Particle Size Classification:**

| Type | Size Range | Examples | Properties |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **True Solution** | < 1 nm | Salt in water, sugar in water | Transparent, homogeneous, particles pass through all membranes |
| **Colloidal Solution** | 1-1000 nm | Milk, fog, smoke | Translucent/opaque, show Tyndall effect, don't settle, pass through filter paper but not membranes |
| **Suspension** | > 1000 nm | Sand in water, muddy water | Opaque, settle on standing, don't pass through filter paper |

**Visual Size Comparison:**
```
Small molecule (< 1 nm)
    ↓
Colloidal particle (1-1000 nm)
    ↓
Suspension particle (> 1000 nm)

```

### 3.3 Condensation Methods

**Principle:** Build colloidal particles from smaller units (atoms, ions, molecules)

#### 3.3.1 Chemical Reduction

**Principle:** Reduce metal salts to metal atoms → aggregate to colloidal size

**Gold Sol (Faraday's Method, 1857):**
```
2AuCl₃ + 3SnCl₂ → 2Au (colloidal) + 3SnCl₄

Reducing agent: Stannous chloride
Color: Deep red to purple (depending on particle size)
```

**Explanation:**
- Colloidal particles (1-1000 nm) comparable to wavelength of visible light (400-700 nm)
- Particles scatter light (Rayleigh scattering)
- True solutions (particles < 1 nm): no scattering
- Suspensions: block light completely

**Tyndall Cone:**
The visible cone of scattered light in colloidal dispersion

**Applications:**

**1. Distinguish colloids from true solutions:**
```

**Discovered by:** Robert Brown (1827), studying pollen grains in water

**Characteristics:**
- Continuous, random motion
- Never ceases (perpetual)
- Independent of nature of particle
- More vigorous for smaller particles
- Increases with temperature
- Decreases with viscosity of medium

**Cause:**
- Unequal bombardment by molecules of dispersion medium
- Thermal motion of molecules
- Particles small enough to be affected

**Explanation:**
```
Molecule collisions:
    ↗ ↖
   ↗   ↖
  →  P  ← (colloidal particle)
   ↘   ↙
    ↘ ↙

Net force varies randomly → random motion
```

**Einstein-Smoluchowski Theory (1905):**

- Temperature: Higher → faster diffusion
- Viscosity: Higher → slower diffusion
- Concentration gradient

**Applications:**

### 6.3 Sedimentation

**Principle:** In gravitational or centrifugal field, particles tend to settle

**For Colloids:**
- Normal gravity: Too slow (Brownian motion dominates)
- Centrifugation: Can sediment colloids

**Stokes' Law:**
```
v = (2r²(ρp - ρm)g)/(9η)

Where:
v = sedimentation velocity
r = particle radius
ρp = particle density
ρm = medium density
g = gravitational acceleration (or centrifugal)
η = viscosity of medium
```

(Stern)     | (Gouy-Chapman)
```

### 7.3 Zeta Potential (ζ-potential)

**Definition:** The potential difference between the surface of tightly bound layer (shear plane) and the electroneutral region of the solution.

**Significance:**

          Colloidal sol
                 
Positively charged particles → Cathode (cataphoresis)
Negatively charged particles → Anode (anaphoresis)
```

- Prevents aggregation

**2. Solvation layer:**
- Layer of dispersion medium around particles
- Mechanical barrier

**For Lyophilic Colloids:**
- Both factors present

**For Lyophobic Colloids:**
- Mainly charge stabilization
- Less stable
- Easy to coagulate

### 8.2 Coagulation (Flocculation)

**Definition:** Process of settling of colloidal particles to form aggregates of larger size, which separate out as precipitate.

**Coagulation vs Precipitation:**
- **Coagulation:** Colloidal → aggregated particles
- **Precipitation:** Dissolved substance → solid

### 8.3 Methods of Coagulation

#### 8.3.1 By Electrolytes (Most Important)

**Mechanism:**
1. Ions of opposite charge neutralize colloidal charge
2. Charge reduced
3. Particles aggregate
4. Settle out

**Hardy-Schulze Rule:**

**Statement:** The coagulating power of an electrolyte is directly proportional to the valence of the ion causing coagulation.

**For Negative Sol (e.g., As₂S₃):**
Coagulated by positive ions:
```
Coagulating Power: Al³⁺ > Ba²⁺ > Na⁺
                   (100)  (30)   (1)

Approximate ratio: 1 : 30 : 1000
```

**For Positive Sol (e.g., Fe(OH)₃):**
Coagulated by negative ions:
```
[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ > PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻
```

**General Rule:**
- For negative sols: cations cause coagulation
- For positive sols: anions cause coagulation
- Higher valence → lower concentration needed

**Explanation:**
- Higher charge → more effective neutralization
- Coagulation power ∝ (valence)⁶ approximately

#### 8.3.2 By Mixing Oppositely Charged Sols

**Principle:** Positive and negative sols neutralize each other

**Example:**
```
Fe(OH)₃ (positive) + As₂S₃ (negative) → Coagulation

Both sols precipitate simultaneously
```

**Mutual Coagulation**

#### 8.3.3 By Heating

**Mechanism:**
- Increases kinetic energy
- Particles collide more frequently
- Solvation layer may be lost
- Aggregation occurs

**Example:**
- Egg albumin sol coagulates on boiling

#### 8.3.4 By Persistent Dialysis

**Mechanism:**
- Removes stabilizing electrolytes completely
- Particles lose charge
- Become unstable
- Coagulate

#### 8.3.5 By Adding Electrolyte

**Mechanism:**
- Compresses electrical double layer
- Reduces zeta potential
- Destabilization

### 8.4 Protective Colloids

**Definition:** Lyophilic colloids that, when added in small amounts to lyophobic sols, protect them from coagulation by electrolytes.

**Mechanism:**
- Form protective layer around lyophobic particles
- Provide steric stabilization
- Increase solvation

**Examples:**
- Gelatin protects gold sol
- Starch protects AgI sol
- Casein (milk protein) protects fat globules in milk

**Gold Number:**
- Measure of protective power
- Milligrams of protective colloid needed to prevent color change (red → blue) of 10 mL gold sol when 1 mL 10% NaCl added

**Lower gold number → greater protective power**

| Protective Colloid | Gold Number (mg) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Gelatin | 0.005-0.01 |
| Albumin | 0.1-0.2 |
| Gum arabic | 0.15-0.25 |
| Starch | 20-25 |
