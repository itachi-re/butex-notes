# Fluid Mechanics

## [cite_start]1. Fundamental Properties [cite: 51]
* **Fluid:** A substance (liquid or gas) that creates no resistance to shear stress when at rest. It continuously deforms under shear force.
* **Rate of Flow ($Q$):** The quantity of fluid flowing per second. $Q = A \times v$.

## [cite_start]2. Classification of Motion [cite: 51]
* **Steady Motion:** Fluid characteristics (velocity, pressure) at a **fixed point** do not change with time ($\partial v / \partial t = 0$).
* **Unsteady Motion:** Characteristics at a point change with time.
* **Uniform Motion:** Velocity is constant with respect to **distance** at any instant ($\partial v / \partial s = 0$).
* **Streamline (Laminar):** Particles move along well-defined paths; layers slide smoothly over one another.
* **Turbulent:** Irregular, chaotic motion occurring above a critical velocity.

## [cite_start]3. Conservation Laws [cite: 51]

### Equation of Continuity (Conservation of Mass)
For an incompressible fluid, the mass entering a section equals the mass leaving it.
$$A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$$
*(Fluid speeds up in narrower pipes).*

### Bernoulli's Equation (Conservation of Energy)
For an ideal, incompressible, steady flow, the total energy per unit volume is constant:
$$P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{Constant}$$

## [cite_start]4. Applications [cite: 51]
* **Torricelli's Theorem (Speed of Efflux):** The velocity of liquid flowing out of a hole is $v = \sqrt{2gh}$.
* **Venturimeter:** A device used to measure the rate of flow ($Q$) in a pipe using Bernoulli's principle.
