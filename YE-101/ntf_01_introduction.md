## 1. Textiles

### 1.1 Definition
- The word **'textile'** comes from the Latin adjective *textilis*, meaning 'woven'
- Stems from *textus*, the past participle of the verb *texere*, 'to weave'
- Originally applied to woven fabrics
- Now encompasses:
  - Fibers
  - Yarns
  - Fabrics
  - Related items

### 1.2 Scope of Textiles
Textiles include fiber-based products in the following categories:
- Threads, cords, ropes, braids
- Woven, knitted and non-woven fabrics
- Lace, rest and embroidery
- Hosiery, knitwear and made-up apparels
- Household textiles
- Soft furnishings and upholstery
- Carpets and other floor-coverings
- Technical, industrial, and engineering textiles
- Geo-textiles
- Medicare textiles

## 2. Fiber

### 2.1 General Definition
A material which consists of fibrous structure where **length is thousand times higher than its width**.

### 2.2 Generic Term
The basic element of material from which yarns, textiles, knits and other substances are made.

### 2.3 Typical Dimensions
- **Length**: 15 to 150 mm
- **Thickness**: 10 mm to 50 mm

## 3. Textile Fiber

### 3.1 Definition
Materials which consist of fibrous structure where:
- Length is **thousand times higher than its width/diameter**
- Can be **spun into yarn**
- Suitable for **weaving or knitting**
- Easily **colored by suitable dye stuff**

### 3.2 Required Characteristics
A textile fiber must contain the following characteristics:

1. **Fibrous structure**
2. **Length** is thousand times higher than its width/diameter
3. **Spinnable** (has spinning quality)
4. **Sufficient strength**
5. **Elasticity and flexibility**
6. **Fineness**
7. **Color**
8. **Dye ability** (affinity to dye)

## 4. Textile Raw Material

### 4.1 Definition
- Also known as: feedstock, unprocessed material, or primary commodity
- Basic material used to produce:
  - Finished products
  - Intermediate materials
  - Feedstock for future finished products

### 4.2 In Textile Context
- Materials that can be converted into **yarns** and **fabrics** of any nature or character
- **Fiber** is the primary raw material used in textile manufacturing

## 5. All Fibers Are NOT Textile Fibers

### 5.1 Definition of Fiber
A unit of matter whose **length is 1000 times longer than its width**.

### 5.2 Why Not All Fibers Are Textile Fibers?
To be a textile fiber, it must possess important qualities:
- Sufficient strength
- Adequate length
- Fineness
- Elasticity
- Crimp
- Friction
- Power to react with acids and alkalis
- Power to protect against biological agents
- Availability

### 5.3 Examples
- ✅ **Cotton, jute**: Have all required qualities → Textile fibers
- ❌ **Banana tree fibers**: Lack elasticity, strength, appearance → NOT textile fibers

**Conclusion**: All fibers are not textile fibers.

## 6. Staple Fiber and Filament

### 6.1 Comparison Table

| Aspect | Staple Fiber | Filament |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Length** | Shorter in length | Continuous in length |
| **Usage** | Used as is | Can be used as is OR cut into staple form |
| **Origin** | Mainly natural fibers | Mainly man-made fibers (except silk) |
| **Length Control** | Nature controls (varies fiber to fiber, lot to lot) | Manufacturer controls (can cut to any desired length) |

### 6.2 Types of Staple Fiber

#### a) Short Staple Fiber
- **Length**: 2 – 15 cm
- **Example**: Cotton

#### b) Long Staple / Technical Fiber
- **Length**: 30 – 200 cm
- **Example**: Jute

### 6.3 Types of Filament

#### a) Monofilament
- **Spinneret**: 1 – 5 holes

#### b) Multi-filament
- **For apparel use**: 10 – 100 holes in spinneret

## 7. Natural Fiber vs Man-Made Fiber

### 7.1 Key Differences

| Property | Natural Fiber | Man-Made Fiber |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Source** | From nature (plants, animals, minerals) | Synthetic/manufactured |
| **Length** | Limited by natural growth | Can be any length |
| **Uniformity** | Varies | Highly uniform |
| **Production** | Seasonal/geographical limitations | Continuous production possible |
| **Cost** | Variable (depends on harvest) | More controlled |
| **Properties** | Fixed by nature | Can be engineered |

## 8. Classification of Natural Fibers

### 8.1 Plant Fibers
- Cotton
- Jute
- Flax
- Hemp
- etc.

### 8.2 Animal Fibers
- Wool
- Silk
- Hair fibers
- etc.

### 8.3 Mineral Fibers
- Asbestos
- etc.

## Notes
- This document provides the foundational concepts for understanding textile fibers
- Focus on understanding the key characteristics that differentiate textile fibers from general fibers
- Length-to-width ratio of 1000:1 is the fundamental criterion for fiber classification
