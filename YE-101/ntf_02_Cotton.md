## 4. Cultivation of Cotton

### 4.1 Growth Timeline

| Week | Stage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Seed planted | Seeds sown |
| 2 | Sprouting | Two leaves appear on plant |
| 5-6 | First flower | First flower appears |
| 8-9 | Blooming | First flower blooms |
| After bloom | Boll formation | Flower falls, leaving boll |
| Boll growth | Seed hair growth | Seed hairs start growing inside bolls |
| 16-18 days | Fiber development | Fiber length and perimeter achieved |
| 22-50 days | Cellulose deposition | Cellulose deposited inside fibers |
| Maturity | Opening | Bolls dry and crack open |
| Harvest | Picking | 1-3 months picking period |
| Post-harvest | Ginning | Separation of cotton fibers from seeds |

### 4.2 Consequent Process Details
1. Seeds usually sown by machine in continuous stream, rows 3-4 feet apart
2. When plants are few inches high, rows must be thinned by cutting undesired plants (chopping)
3. Upland cotton grows to ~4 feet height
4. Blooms 2-3 months after planting
5. Blossoms last only a few days
6. When boll falls off, boll (seed pod) begins to develop
7. Bolls contain seeds to which fibers are attached
8. When ripe, bolls burst exposing soft, fluffy mass of fibers
9. Cotton must be picked soon after opening to prevent:
   - Discoloration from sun exposure
   - Dirt accumulation from weather
10. Uneven development requires multiple pickings across field

---

## 5. Ginning

### 5.1 Definition
Process of separating cotton fibers from seeds.

### 5.2 Seed Cotton
Freshly picked cotton with seeds still attached.

### 5.3 Objects of Ginning
1. Separate fibers fully from seeds
2. Collect seeds and waste together
3. Collect fiber without any faults
4. Separate whole fiber

### 5.4 Types of Ginning
1. Saw ginning
2. Roller ginning
3. Macarthy ginning

---

## 6. Saw Ginning

- **Disc number**: 10-100 discs
- **Production capacity**: 100-1000 kg/hr

### 6.2 Procedure
1. Cotton with seed stored in hopper feeder by feed table or air flow
2. Spiked roller throws cotton with seed onto grid bar
3. Saw discs permit entry of seed-free fiber through bar holes
4. Empty path of bars (both sides of saw teeth) permits fiber entry but not seeds
5. Separated seeds fall onto conveyors
6. Cotton lints separated from saw teeth by air flow
7. Separated cotton lints transported by conveyor pipe

### 6.3 Gin Stand Details
- **Saw diameter**: 30.5 to 45.7 cm (12 to 18 inches)
- **Saw spacing**: 0.5 to 1 inch apart
- **Saws per mandrel**: Up to 198 saws stacked on single mandrel
- **Capacity evolution**: From <1 bale/hour to >15 bales/hour
- **Typical US plant**: 3-4 gin stands per plant
- **Processing rate**: Few to over 100 bales/hour
- **Fiber-seed attachment force**: ~55% of breaking force

### 6.4 Quality Considerations
- Gin stands must be properly adjusted and maintained
- Operate at or below design capacity
- Overloading reduces cotton quality
- Short fiber content increases with:
  - Ginning rate above manufacturer's recommendation
  - Increased saw speed
- High ginning rate increases yarn imperfections
- Seed damage occurs with:
  - High ginning rate
  - Low seed moisture (2-8% damage range)

---

## 7. Roller Ginning

### 7.1 Main Component
**Spiked roller** - separates seeds from fiber by air flow

### 7.2 Working Procedure
1. Seeded fiber contacts feed roller
2. Seeded fibers embedded on two feed rollers → fed to spiked roller
3. Trash removed by spike action → stored in trash chamber via perforated sheet
4. Seeded fiber passes through inclined net by air flow → attaches to spiked drum
5. Accelerating drum separates and passes cotton fiber
6. Accelerating drum transports cotton fibers
7. Rough surface of functional roller takes only fibers
8. Seeds retained on backing roller
9. Doffing roller separates fibers from functional roller
10. Fibers transported through delivery pipe
11. Seeds fall onto conveyor

### 7.3 Components List
1. Feed hopper
2. Feed roller
3. Spiked drum
4. Net
5. Inclined net
6. Drum
7. Ejecting drum
