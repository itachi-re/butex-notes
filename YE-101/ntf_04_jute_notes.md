# Jute Fibre: The Golden Fibre of Bangladesh

## 1. Introduction and Historical Background

Jute is a ligno-cellulosic natural bast fibre obtained from plants of the genus *Corchorus*, belonging to the Malvaceae family. The name "jute" is derived from the Bengali word "jhuto" or "jhuta." Due to its golden color and significant economic value, jute is called the "Golden Fibre," particularly in Bangladesh, which is the world's second-largest producer, accounting for approximately 42% of global production.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Botanical Names:** *Corchorus capsularis* (White jute), *Corchorus olitorius* (Tossa jute)
- **Fibre Type:** Natural cellulosic bast fibre
- **Production Regions:** Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, China, Nepal, Thailand
- **Annual Production:** Approximately 3-4 million metric tons globally
- **Historical Significance:** Second only to cotton in quantity produced and diversity of use

### Etymology and Cultural Significance
The word "jute" comes from the Bengali "jhuto," reflecting its deep roots in Bengali culture. In Bangladesh, jute was once the primary export commodity and a cornerstone of the economy, particularly after independence in 1971, when approximately 4 million farmers were directly or partially involved in jute cultivation.

### Role of Key Components

#### Cellulose
- Long-chain polymer of glucose units (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ
- Provides tensile strength
- Degree of polymerization: 5,000-10,000
- Crystalline and amorphous regions
- Hydrophilic nature

#### Hemicellulose
- Shorter chain polysaccharides
- More amorphous than cellulose
- Side chains branching from main chain
- Acidic in nature
- Gives jute slight acidic reaction
- Provides affinity for basic dyestuffs

#### Lignin
- Complex phenolic polymer
- Not composed of sugar units (unlike cellulose)
- Contains methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl groups
- Acts as natural cement binding fibres
- Increases strength but reduces flexibility
- Responsible for yellow to brown coloration
- Cannot be completely removed without fibre damage

### Fibre Structure

**Multi-level Organization:**

1. **Ultimate Fibres (Single Cells):**
   - Length: 1-4 mm
   - Diameter: 10-25 μm
   - Individual elongated cells with thick walls

2. **Technical Fibres (Fibre Bundles):**
   - 5-10 ultimate fibres in cross-section
   - Thousands in lengthwise direction
   - Cemented together by lignin and pectin
   - Length: 1-4 meters (commercial length)
   - This is what we process and use

3. **Macroscopic Structure:**
   - Long, coarse, strong threads
   - Golden to brown color
   - Natural lustre
   - Rough texture

### Morphological Structure

**Longitudinal View:**

**Harvesting Methods:**
1. **Manual Cutting:** Using sickle at ground level
2. **Uprooting:** In waterlogged areas
3. **Machine Harvesting:** Limited use in large farms

**Post-Harvest Handling:**
- Stems tied in bundles
- Stood upright for 2-3 days
- Leaves naturally shed or removed
- Ready for retting

### Retting Process

Retting is the crucial biological process that separates jute fibres from the woody stem through microbial decomposition of pectin and other binding materials.

#### Water Retting (Traditional Method)

**Process Steps:**
1. **Bundling:** Stems tied in bundles (10-15 cm diameter)
2. **Submersion:** Bundles placed in slow-running water
3. **Weighting:** Kept submerged with bamboo/logs
4. **Microbial Action:** Bacteria decompose pectin
5. **Duration:** 15-20 days (temperature dependent)

**Retting Conditions:**

- pH: 6.5-7.5
- Water depth: 1-1.5 meters
- Water quality: Soft water preferred

**Types of Water Retting:**

- **River Retting:** In slow-moving rivers
- **Tank Retting:** In constructed tanks

**Retting Completion Signs:**
