## 1. Introduction to Textile Fibres

### 1.1 Fundamental Definitions

**Textile**: A comprehensive term encompassing all fibres, yarns, and fabrics used in the creation of cloth and related materials.

**Textile Fibre**: A fundamental unit of matter characterized by sufficient length, strength, and flexibility that enables it to be processed and spun into yarn for fabric production.

### 1.2 Classification of Textile Fibres

Textile fibres are broadly categorized into two main groups:

**A. Natural Fibres** (derived from natural sources)
- **Plant-based (Cellulosic)**
  - Seed fibres: Cotton, Kapok
  - Bast fibres: Jute, Flax, Hemp, Ramie
  - Leaf fibres: Sisal, Pineapple
  - Fruit fibres: Coir (coconut)
  
- **Animal-based (Protein)**
  - Hair fibres: Wool, Mohair, Cashmere, Alpaca
  - Secretion fibres: Silk (from silkworms)
  
- **Mineral-based**
  - Asbestos

**B. Man-made/Synthetic Fibres**
- Regenerated: Rayon, Modal, Lyocell
- Synthetic: Polyester, Nylon, Acrylic, Spandex

### 1.3 Historical Background

The use of textile fibres dates back to ancient civilizations:
- **Cotton**: Cultivated in the Indus Valley (5000 BCE)
- **Flax**: Used in ancient Egypt for linen mummy wrappings (3000 BCE)
- **Wool**: Domesticated sheep provided fibres (10,000 BCE)
- **Silk**: Discovered in China during the Neolithic period (3500 BCE)
- **Industrial Revolution**: Mechanization transformed textile production (18th-19th century)
- **20th Century**: Development of synthetic fibres revolutionized the industry

### 1.4 Properties of an Ideal Textile Fibre

For a material to function effectively as a textile fibre, it must possess:

1. **High Length-to-Width Ratio**: Minimum ratio of 1000:1 for adequate yarn formation
2. **Adequate Strength**: Sufficient tenacity to withstand processing and end-use stresses
3. **Flexibility**: Ability to bend without breaking, essential for fabric drape and handle
4. **Cohesiveness**: Capacity for fibres to cling together during spinning
5. **Uniformity**: Consistency in diameter and properties along the fibre length
6. **Elasticity**: Ability to recover from deformation
7. **Durability**: Resistance to wear, chemical action, and environmental conditions

### 1.5 Standard Structure of Textile Fibres

Most natural fibres exhibit a hierarchical structure:

**Cellulosic Fibres (Plant-based)**:
- Primary cell wall (outer protective layer)

- Lumen (central hollow channel in some fibres)

**Protein Fibres (Animal-based)**:
- Cuticle/Scales (outer protective layer)
- Cortex (main body containing protein chains)
- Medulla (inner core, present in some fibres)

### 1.6 Types of Bonding in Fibres
